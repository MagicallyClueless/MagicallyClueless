<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>
This is my personal website, mostly to have a place for my art, writing, characters, and other projects! Though this is certainly more for me, this might be a good place for folks to catch up with my work or to have for reference. I hope you have fun browsing and exploring the website!

<br><br>

I would like to do commissions someday, but I don't really have the time for it right now. My art is a very passionate hobby.
